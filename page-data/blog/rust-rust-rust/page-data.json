Initially, the language was a personal project that aimed to combine the performance of C and C++ with the safety and convenience of modern programming languages. Since then, Rust has gained popularity in the systems programming community and has been adopted as a sponsored project by Mozilla.</p>\n<h2>Useful Resources</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Rust Programming Language - The Rust Programming Language (rust-lang.org)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Rust-Web-Programming-2nd-Edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub - PacktPublishing/Rust-Web-Programming-2nd-Edition: Rust Web Programming - Second Edition, published by Packt</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GitHub - LemmyNet/lemmy: üêÄ A link aggregator and forum for the fediverse</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rust, Rust, Rust","description":"why rust?","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/800fa8a6b63974990f73c216e6c6c296/c7a62/dcf7454cfbc7924eda9e506bb84a8bf8cf506f39.jpg","height":630,"width":1200}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rust-rust-rust/","previousPost":null,"nextPost":{"title":"Vue vs React, Code Comparison","slug":"/vue-vs-react-code-comparison/"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2238422722","3868140423"]}
